## What is frp

[frp](https://github.com/fatedier/frp) is a fast reverse proxy that allows you to expose a local server located behind a NAT or firewall to the Internet. It currently supports TCP and UDP, as well as HTTP and HTTPS protocols, enabling requests to be forwarded to internal services via domain name.


## The purpose of this repo

The frp tools have the Server Side and Client Side, but the client side config depends on the server side configuration, so this repo aims to simplify the client side configuration by using the visual form and download the config file after complete the form.
